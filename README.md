java-learning-lab is a structured Java learning and practice repository focused on backend-oriented skills and software quality. Work is organized by topic and validated primarily through automated unit tests (JUnit), reinforcing clean code habits, refactoring, and solid object-oriented design. As the learning path progresses, the repository evolves into a Spring Boot REST API module with its corresponding test suite.

Goals

Build strong Java fundamentals (OOP, collections, exceptions, best practices).

Practice a test-first mindset and basic TDD through katas and small exercises.

Maintain a portfolio-ready codebase for technical interviews and backend work.

Progressively develop a Spring Boot REST API with automated tests.

Planned structure

java-core-katas/ — topic-based exercises validated with JUnit (OOP, collections, exceptions, etc.).

spring-boot-api/ — a simple REST API with tests (later stage).

docs/ — concise notes, learning checklist, and technical decisions.

What will be included

Topic-based exercises and katas.

Unit tests and incremental refactoring.

Backend-oriented modules (non-CLI) as the repository grows.
